<h1>Welcome to Mr. Science</h1>
<p>
Mr. Science is a versatile scientific calculator that uses Reverse Polish Notation 
(RPN) similar to HP calculators. It provides a wide array of built-in math, 
statistical functions and unit conversions. Mr. Science is also a programmer's 
calculator, operating on hexadecimal, binary and octal numbers. Mr. Science is 
programmable so any conceivable function can be added to the 8 available user keys.
</p>
<h1>How RPN Works</h1>
<p>
RPN is confusing to many people. But once you get used to it, using Mr. Science is fast
and easy. This is especially true because the "hidden" registers can be seen in the
upper right corner of the display. Mr. Science uses the same style of RPN that is used
in HP calculators. In fact, if you've used with HP calculators then you'll be 
familiar with many of the keys found in Mr. Science.
</p>
<p>
With RPN, you enter the numbers you want to work with and then tell the calculator 
what you want to do with them. This is really simple for functions which operate
on a single number, like SIN. You simply press 4 5 SIN and you get the sine of 
45 degrees (assuming you're in DEG mode, as shown in the upper left corner of the
display). For operations taking two numbers, you use the ENTER key. To add you
hit 2 ENTER 3 + and you get the sum of 2 and 3 and the display shows 5. These 
binary operations work on the numbers in the 'x' and 'y' registers. The 'y' register
is shown in the upper right and the 'x' register is the big number displayed in the
middle of the display. For operations that matter (like division) the operation is
y / x, with the y operator always coming first.
</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>
As in HP calculators, Mr. Science has a 4 register "stack". When you hit the ENTER 
key, number are pushed "up" the stack: whatever was in the x register moves to the
y register, y moves to z, z moves to t and whatever was in the t register is lost.
If you do this you'll notice that the value that was in the x register also stays
in the x register. It is essentially duplicated. This makes it really easy to do
things like squaring a number. 12 ENTER * will show 144, which is x^2.
</p>
<p>
Some operations automatically perform an ENTER operation. For instance if you were
to go 1 ENTER 2 +, you'd see a 3 in the x register. If you then type a 4, an
implicit ENTER will be performed, so you'll see the 3 move into the y register.
This is what makes it easy to do chain calculations. In the above situation, if 
you hit + 5 + 6 +, you'll get the result of adding all those numbers together.
</p>
<p>
There one other interesting stack movement that happens automatically. Let's say
you have the values 4 6 11 and 15 in x, y, z and t. If you press the '+' key
The 4 and 6 are added and you get 10 in the x register. But the y value goes
away as well to be replaced by z and then z is replaced by t. The values "pop
down". That's nice because it lets you have temporary results on the stack
for use later. So if you wanted to do (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) you can press:
3 4 + 5 6 + *. The temporary result from the 3 + 4 operation is stored while
adding 5 + 6, so the final operation is 7 * 11 and you get 77.
</p>
<p>
The 't' register is special. When the stack pops down, whatever value was in
the 't' register before stays there. It essentially gets copied to the
y register. So now you have two copies. You can use this to perform operations
by the same number over and over. Let's say you want to multiply a bunch of
numbers by 5. Simply press 5 ENTER ENTER ENTER, which copies the 5 into
all 4 registers. Now enter any number and hit *. Notice that ...
</p>
<p>
You can also do other operations to the stack like ROLLv and ROLL^. The simply
rotate each register value in the direction indicated, with the value on one
end moving to the other end. So ROLL^ is x -> y -> z -> t -> x. 
</p>
<p>
There's one more register shown on the display 'lastx'. That's the value 
that was in the x register just before the last operation. For instance,
if you hit 3 4 +, the the x register will contain 7 and lastx will contain
4, the value that had just been in the x register. That's nice because it
let's you undo the operation. Just hit LASTX (which is 2ND ENTER) and now
you have 4 in the x register and 7 gets pushed into the y register. Then 
hit - (the opposite of +) and the result is 3. Hit LASTX again and now
4 is in x and 3 is in y, just like when you started.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the 't' register is special. When 
</p>
<h1>Programming</h1>
<p>
Programming Mr. Science is quick and easy. You select FUN QUIK. You'll notice that the 
R/S button in the lower left corner of the main buttons has changed to PRG. This means 
you are in the programming mode. Any keystrokes you enter from now on will be entered in 
the current program. Press PRG to see the current program. The list on the right shows the 
instructions currently entered. With a highlight on the current instruction. New keystrokes 
are added before this instruction. You can scroll this list and double tap on an instruction
to select it. New keystrokes will now go before the selected instruction. Double tap
on the header bar at the top of the list to center the current instruction.
</p>
<h2>Programming Basics</h2>
<p>
Programs in Mr. Science use the same RPN system as in normal operation. To execute a
program you've entered, leave programming mode by pressing FUN QUIK again. You'll
see the lower left key has changed back to R/S. Press this key to execute the
program you entered from the beginning. Whatever is in the x, y, z, and t registers 
when the program starts are used by the executing program. For instance, you 
could add 1 to any number in the x register with the simple 2 instruction program 
"1; ADD". If you put a number in the x register and execute, you will see a number 
one greater than the one you entered. Pressing R/S repeatedly would increment
the number in the x register over and over.
</p>
<h2>Assigning User Keys</h2>
<p>
The technique above is the <em>Quick Program</em> method of programming. It lets 
you quickly create a program and use it right away. But you can also save
programs and assign them to user keys. When you first enter keystrokes you are
making an <em>anomymous function</em>, a function with no name and not assigned
to any user key. By pressing PRG FUNC you give the current function a name and
it gets automatically assigned to the next available user key (on the FUN button
panel). The user key shows the function name and when you press it, the function
is executed. You can store up to 8 user functions. When you press PRG FUNC you
get an alphanumeric keyboard with all the letters and numbers you can use
in your function name. Pressing the shift key in the lower right corner gives
you many symbols to use. On the lowest row, in addition to the shift key
you can backspace, cancel the operation, or press OK, which accepts the name
and assigns the key.
</p>
<h2>Creating Additional Functions</h2>
<p>
Once you've named your function, you can press the PRG NEW key to create a new
anonymous function after the current one. Then you can enter more keystrokes
and assign the function to another user key.
